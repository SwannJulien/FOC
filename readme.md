# Overview

In this reportory you can see the projects I built during my second year of studies of *Grado Superior Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web* (similar to an Associate Degree).

As the first year is more focused on **Java, OOP, SQL and HTML-CSS**, the second year is really focused on client side programming with Javascript and server side programming with PHP. 
 
## Desarrollo Web Entorno Cliente

This subject is all about client side programming: **HTML, CSS, Javascript** but we have also seen **Ajax** techniques, **JQuery**, and **Angular** framework.

## Desarrollo Web Entorno Servidor

This subject focused on server side programming with **PHP**. We have learnt how to built a website using **MVC arquitecture**, how to connect to relational database with **PDO** and work with data and also a learnt the fundamentals of **Symphony and Laravel**.

# Session y Cookie

## Instructions
1. Build a login form with username and password.
2. Send the data to the server and check if they are valid.
3. If the username and password are valid, create a session and store the username in it. Then open a new page called sesion.php.
4. Sesion.php first check if the session has been created and if it's not the case, will exit sesion.php and come back automatically to index.php.
5. Then sesion.php will ask to the user through a form to complete its phone number, email and to choose between different options in a list.
6. The selected option will be stored in a cookie
